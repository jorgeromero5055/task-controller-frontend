## Live Demo

A hosted version of the app is available at the following link: 
Note: The app may take up to 30 seconds to respond to a request if it has been inactive for more than 15 minutes. This delay is due to the backend being hosted on Renderâ€™s free tier, which incurs a server cold start when inactive for more than 15 minutes.

## Note

To spin up this app locally, you will need the following valid Firebase fields in a `.env` file in the root of the project 

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id

You will need to obtain these credentials from your Firebase account under Project Settings in the Firebase Console.

Yout will also need the following field in the `.env` to properly connect with the backend 

backendUrl='https://task-controller-backend.onrender.com/graphql'

Without these fields, the app cannot connect to Firebase for authentication.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/task-controller-frontend.git

2. Add a .env file to the root of the project with the following Firebase fields:
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
   backendUrl='https://task-controller-backend.onrender.com/graphql'

   Note: Without these fields, the app cannot connect to Firebase for authentication or the backend.

4. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd task-controller-frontend

5. Clone the repository:
   npm install

6. Clone the repository:
   npm start

## Backend

The app requires a separate backend server to function. The backend handles all GraphQL queries and mutations. Refer to the backend repository for more details.
